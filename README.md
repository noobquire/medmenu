# medmenu
TF2 medic menu by ostrich
v. 1.0 release | 21.11.16

Setup:
1) Copy medmenu folder to your tf/cfg folder
2) In medic.cfg, add in the end "exec medmenu/medmenu"
3) In other class configs (scout, soldier, pyro, demo, etc .cfg) add "exec medmenu/disablemedmenu"
4) Open medmenu/settings.cfg and adjust your settings
5) In-game, put your mediguns in medic loadouts the following way:
A - Default medigun
B - Kritzkrieg
C - Quick-Fix
D - Vaccinator

The menu is controlled with numpad, you can add your own bindings for other keys if you want
Menu features:
- Uber counting with one key and reset
- Teammate radar, allows you to find your team quickly
- Uber faking
- Changing spawns with no uber percentage loss
- Enemy uber percentage chat messages
- Spy disguise team chat messages
- Suicide (no rly)

Q: Is this menu automatically tracking your/enemy uber percentage?
A: No, you have to do this yourself and press the corresponding key, the menu will only notify your teammates

Q: I don't like some feature of the menu and want to disable it. How do i do it?
A: Go to settings.cfg and read it carefully. If the feature you want to disable is not there, you may go to medmenu.cfg and try it yourself, however code is quite complicated there, even though i tried to add explanations everywhere. 

Q: I found a bug!
A: Go contact me on Steam:

Q: May i edit this menu or use some features from it?
A: Yes, you can. That would be great if you also sign me as an original author somewhere :)
